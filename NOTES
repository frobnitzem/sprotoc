The autogenerated code simply counts the number of
required fields that were read.  This count will be wrong
if the same required message is read > 1x.

Because of that, I didn't have the heart to count the required
fields and check -- so it's not checked.


To generate stubs, set the 'stubs' parameter on calling sprotoc,
like so:

sprotoc --c_out=stubs=stub:. test1.proto
 -> generates stub.c and stub.h
    along with the usual test1.pb-c.c and test1.pb-c.h

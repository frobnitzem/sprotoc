Conditions for Using Sprotoc:

The distribution terms for sprotoc-generated protocol buffer code permit using the generated code in nonfree programs.

The c-source code in sprotoc/ and include files in include/sprotoc are required for using the generated code, and have been released under an apache license.
This exception applies when sprotoc is generating code for a protocol buffer parser or serializer.
